### Buttonless behaviour

üí° If you want to trigger the widget using a custom HTML tag element (button, link, div, etc.), follow the following steps:

1. at the end of the `<head>` tag (just before `\</head>`) add the following line:

```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/magma-app/magma-widget@latest/src/widget-v3.min.js"
  type="text/javascript"
></script>
```

2. add **magma-trigger-id="custom-button"** to the HTML tag of your choice as shown here (in this example a button):

```html
<button magma-trigger-id="custom-button">
  click here to trigger the widget
</button>
```

3. add one of the 2 following lines (after your custom HTML tag element):

- If you have set multiple campaigns on your admin dashboard, you should add the following line

```html
<magma-widget
  identifier-organization="xxxx"
  magma-trigger-id="custom-button"
  magma-hidden
></magma-widget>
```

- If you have set only one campaign on your admin dashboard or if you want to directly redirect to a campaign, you should add the following line

```html
<magma-widget
  identifier-campaign="xxxx"
  magma-trigger-id="custom-button"
  magma-hidden
></magma-widget>
```

4. don't forget to replace "xxxxx" with the organization identifier or the campaign identifier we've provided you with.

### Chatbot behavior

üí° If you want to use the widget with a chatbot behavior, add **"fab"** as shown below

```html
<magma-widget identifier="xxxx" fab></magma-widget>
```

![Line-step](https://magma-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/widget-instruction2-fab.PNG)

Then, add the line just before the end of the body tag. \
‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful, do not add the line into a div, as precised into the above screenshot.

### Change button label

You can change the default label for the button by adding the **name** attribute as shown in the example below

```html
<magma-widget identifier="xxxx" name="My custom label"></magma-widget>
```

You can also manage the language by adding special attributes **name**-_"the language local"_.
For now we support french (fr) and english (en). See example below

```html
<magma-widget
  identifier="xxxx"
  name-fr="Mon label personnalis√©"
  name-en="My custom label"
></magma-widget>
```

### Add source (utm)

You can add a utm if you need by adding an attribute **source**

```html
<magma-widget identifier="xxxx" source="my-utm"></magma-widget>
```

By adding a source, you will be able to track where your helpees come from and you will get the information directly on your Magma admin dashboard.
