Then, add the line just before the end of the body tag. \
‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful, do not add the line into a div, as precised into the above screenshot.

3. replace "xxxxx" with "identifier_we_have_provided_you". 
To find YOUR identifier, please refer to the information provided during the setup with Magma.
```html
<magma-widget identifier="identifier_we_have_provided_you"></magma-widget>
```
